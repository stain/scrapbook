<h1><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h1>
<p>This project requires Python 2.2. The module sets.py from Python 2.3 is
included.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="usage">
<h1><a name="usage">Usage</a></h1>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Create a seperate Python module creating the events and 
a TimeNet to store the time relations between them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>example.py:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/env python

from timeshift import *
import relation

E1 = Event(&quot;E1&quot;, &quot;Mary went to the airport&quot;)
E2 = Event(&quot;E2&quot;, &quot;Peter bought a car&quot;)
E3 = Event(&quot;E3&quot;, &quot;Peter drove Mary to the airport&quot;)
E4 = Event(&quot;E4&quot;, &quot;Mary flew from Trondheim to Oslo&quot;)

net = TimeNet()
net.addrelation(relation.before, E1, E4) # went before flew
net.addrelation(relation.before, E2, E3) # bought before drove
net.addrelation(relation.equals, E1, E3) # drove and went at same time

# Check one particular relation, what about her flight
# and Peters car purchase?
print E4, net.net[E4,E1], E1

# Print all 'known' knowledge
net.print_knowledge()
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Run the module and examine the results:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
: stain&#64;ozelot ~/timeshift;python example.py
E4 Set([&gt;]) E1
Mary flew from Trondheim to Oslo is after Mary went to the airport
Mary flew from Trondheim to Oslo is after Peter bought a car
Mary flew from Trondheim to Oslo is after Peter drove Mary to the airport
Mary went to the airport is before Mary flew from Trondheim to Oslo
Mary went to the airport is after Peter bought a car
Mary went to the airport equals Peter drove Mary to the airport
Peter bought a car is before Mary flew from Trondheim to Oslo
Peter bought a car is before Mary went to the airport
Peter bought a car is before Peter drove Mary to the airport
Peter drove Mary to the airport is before Mary flew from Trondheim to Oslo
Peter drove Mary to the airport equals Mary went to the airport
Peter drove Mary to the airport is after Peter bought a car
</pre>
<p>The first outputted line shows that the only possible relation
between E4 and E1 is &gt; - meaning that E4 is after E1, Mary's flight
was after Peter's car purchase</p>
<p>The other output is all the knowledge that the system knows 'for
sure'. Such knowledge is relations between nodes where there is only
one possible relation.  Note that this includes the basic facts
initially added and their inverse values.  (Ie both &quot;E1 before E4&quot;
and &quot;E4 after E1&quot;).</p>
<p>Relations between other nodes (events) are not printed, as there
is only partly or no knowledge on what relations might exist.
In more advanced examples, this could be relations such that 
'E1 is before, finishes, during or meeting E2'.</p>

<h1><a name="note">Note</a></h1>
<p>There is a (intended?) bug in the Add-algorithm in <a class="citation-reference" href="#allen" id="id5" name="id5">[Allen]</a>. Allen's first
for-loop finds new transitivity information for N(k,j), but then checks
R(k,i) for new information instead of R(k,j). The fix is to replace
(k,i) with (k,j) in the if-test:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
if R(k,j) ispropersubset N(k,j)
    then add &lt;k,j&gt; to ToDo;
